ReFill Hub: Data-Driven Market Intelligence Dashboard

This project is a comprehensive, data-driven analysis for the "ReFill Hub" business concept, created for the MGB Data Analytics group assignment. It uses a synthetic market survey dataset of 600 respondents to perform market segmentation, predict customer adoption, estimate spending, and find product associations.

The entire analysis is packaged into an interactive web dashboard built with Streamlit.

🚀 Features

The dashboard is organized into five key sections:

Executive Summary: High-level metrics on market potential, including projected adoption rate, average willingness to pay, and key visualizations of customer demographics.

Customer Segmentation (Clustering): Uses K-Means Clustering to group customers into four distinct personas based on their attitudes. Features an interactive 3D plot and detailed strategic recommendations for each segment.

Predictive Simulator (Classification & Regression): A powerful tool that allows you to simulate a new customer profile. It uses two separate machine learning models to predict:

Adoption Likelihood: The probability (%) that this customer will use ReFill Hub.

Spending Potential: The estimated amount (AED) this customer is willing to spend per visit.

Market Basket Analysis (Association): Uses the Apriori algorithm to discover "if-then" rules about which products are frequently bought together. Includes filters for lift and confidence and provides insights for product bundling.

Model Performance & Methodology: A transparent report card showing the performance scores (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, R², RMSE, Silhouette Score) for all models used in the dashboard, as required by the assignment.
